# CS2 Marketplace IDs

Most tradable CS2 in-game items' Name/ID pairs from various item marketplaces such as [buff163](https://buff.163.com), [Youpin898 (UU)](https://www.youpin898.com/) and [buff.market](https://buff.market/) can be found here including [Community Maps, Charms, and More](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/498333631688738072), [Show Off](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/514095143786120351) and [Tonight's Forecast: Rain-cient](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/657081807721726187) items. All items' Goods IDs, Applied Sticker IDs (including exclusively pre-applied stickers), Applied Patch IDs, Doppler Phase IDs and some items' pattern tiers can be found within a single JSON file.<br>

Some known missing items (including items from the new Genesis Collection) and Doppler phases that is seen to exist/not exist which aren't registered on buff163, Youpin898 and buff.market are also listed here.<br>

Some stickers and patches can have other Sticker/Patch ID-Name pairs on buff163 with the name being the same that have a lower quantity of listings of the same kind of sticker applied (e.g. Rush 4x20 (Holo), CRUC1AL | Paris 2023)<br>
