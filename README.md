# CS2 Marketplace IDs

Most tradable CS2 in-game items' Name/ID pairs from various item marketplaces such as [buff163](https://buff.163.com), [Youpin898 (UU)](https://www.youpin898.com/) and [buff.market](https://buff.market/) can be found here including [The Fourth Season](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/511855214544814590), [The Starladder Budapest Major 2025](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/578276333072682038) and [Community Maps, Charms, and More](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/498333631688738072) items. All items' Goods IDs, Applied Sticker IDs (including exclusively pre-applied stickers), Applied Patch IDs, Applied Charm/Sticker Slab IDs, Doppler Phase IDs and some items' pattern tiers can be found within a single JSON file.<br>

Some known missing items (including items from the Budapest 2025 Major), Doppler phases and Fire and Ice pattern tier tag IDs for certain Marble Fade knives which aren't registered on buff163, Youpin898, or buff.market are listed on [knownmissing.txt](https://github.com/ModestSerhat/cs2-marketplace-ids/blob/main/knownmissing.txt) and [knownmissingslabs.txt](https://github.com/ModestSerhat/cs2-marketplace-ids/blob/main/knownmissingslabs.txt) for each marketplace missing sticker slab IDs.

Some stickers and patches can have other Sticker/Patch ID-Name pairs on buff163 with the name being the same that have a lower quantity of listings of the same kind of sticker applied (e.g. Rush 4x20 (Holo), CRUC1AL | Paris 2023)<br>
